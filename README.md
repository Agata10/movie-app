## About

Tha website is the task from Software Engineering Bootcamp.
<br>
The requirements were to create single-page website and practice AJAX, fetch API, Promises and Modules ES6.
<br>The app has single page, user can search for movies by title.
<br>The user can add favourites, see details if clicked on the cards, the app shows also 10 popular movies for today.

<br>I was using `FLEXBOX` for layout.

The main tasks:

1. Create app to practice POST, GET requests.
2. I used TMDB api (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)
3. All API calls handle by try/catch blocks and checking if response.ok

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage
- FETCH API

## Future app possibilities

There are possibilities to expand app for more features like:

1. Refactoring to React
2. Or using webpack to bundle files
3. Change single-page webiste to be more complex, many-sites
4. I want to add to card with additional info, displaying of actors
